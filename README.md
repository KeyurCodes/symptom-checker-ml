Symptom Checker ML Model 🤖🩺

A Machine Learning–based symptom classifier that predicts possible medical conditions based on user-written symptoms.
This project includes:

A trained ML classifier (symptom_clf_big.joblib)

A TF-IDF vectorizer (tfidf_vect_big.joblib)

A Python app (app_big.py) that loads the model & predicts symptoms

A CSV dataset used for training
